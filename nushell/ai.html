<p><a->Later additions (2026-01-14) are in green. I also fixed some spelling-mistakes.</a-></p>
<p><a->I wrote this as a breakdown of my emotions at the time.<br>I am not in the best emotional spot. I want to go back to a pre-GPT2 world (but i understand that it is impossible and try to see it objectively). and i feel overwhelmed by AI+politics+..<br>The reason why its here is not to make it public (its only linked in the discord, added to the robots.txt, and i will probably delete it after a month or something), but just to have formatted long text (while keeping the discord-channel kind of clean).</a-></p>
<p><a->AI is immoral (according to my moral compass), but so are a lot of things (using google/microsoft products, meat, piracy, GPS was created for war, etc). Some people buy organic meat, and i avoid LLMs wherever possible.</a-></p>

while).<ul><li>I once asked it "floppy disk emoji", it told me it does not exist,

to Ai, curl being overwhelmed by AI-slob, etc}, how about not
monetarily supporting that company?<h2 id=nus-current-situation>Nu's current situation</h2><p>Nu feels like <a->it is becoming</a-> a AI <a->supportive (not just inclusive)</a-> community.<br>Its not a single thing, but just the sum of a lot of things.<br>Some feel at home in such communities, I do not. <a->Example reasons (once again: not personal and i can understand the reasons behind the decisions):</a-><ul><li>For a while >33% of discord profiles had
<code>zed</code>/claude/.. or similar in their tag/description/..<li><code>#help</code> gets treated like a GPT windows <a->by some individuals</a-><ul><li>just dump error and <code>fix it</code>. no thanks, etc. <a->(i sound like Vance here.. i just mean the general vibe is not a conversation between humans (with one asking another fan for help), but like a human-maschine or microsoft-support-ticket)</a-><li>some don't read the error/code at all (someone had
<code>def [foo # arg1] {…</code> - and despite the error,
sytax-highlight, LSP, etc all pointing it out they still posted it; also
no thanks/..)</ul><li>before core-team-meets start <code>zed</code>/.. get discussed
positively<li>if you search for new github-repos with nu you get vibe-coded stuff
and tools for helping with vibecoding<li>there are multiple AI channels in the discord<li>many of the more prominent community members have AI/blockchain/..
in their other projects<li>people advertising their vibe-code business multiple times a month
in <code>#general</code> (and doing nothing else) get zero
repercussions <a->(literally not a single other message and not even a "hey, stop it" from a admin)</a-><li><code>mcp</code> is apparently now a default feature <a->(it used to be opt-in and is pretty uncommon in other projects)</a-><li>vibe-coded commits<ul><li>disclosure is good<ul><li>the comment in the discord about
<code>just removing claude as co-author and thus not ending up on the list</code>
caused <strong>strong</strong> feelings inside of me.. <a->(looked it up: it was just discussed if it would technically be possible since it "taints" the repository (by the way: no GitHub does not include co-authors in search results), but i (still) read it as <code>if we could i would vote for it</code>)</a-><ul><li>even if that does not happen it has still shaken my trust even more
that retroactively removing a disclosure made by the commit author is
being discussed..</ul></ul><li>once again: all the anti-AI stuff from above<li>when i noticed the first disclosed commit within the
<code>mcp</code> i disliked it, but it was behind a
disabled-by-default-feature-flag (which non-slob-producers don't
enable), so i did not speak up<li>while writing this i found a vibe-coded PR which obviously had ZERO
human review.. please add a "you understand your code" requirement to
the PR-template (tho they also did not touch the template, so they
probably did not read that.. in my repository depending on the justification
that would be a ban) <a->(turns out: one vibe-coded added it to their fork and some other vibe-coder opened the PR (without the original authors permission?) - in any case: no description, SUPER obvious errors, unordered commits, etc)</a-></ul></ul><p>Once again: when should you speak up?<br>I am a random user (not a core-team member or anything).<br>Each step was small and it felt like most core-members are at least not
opposed to it.<br>And saying <code>no</code> to the mcp-commit would've felt like i am
criticising and gate-keeping one person (and since i had a bad first
impression due to the block-chain stuff on the profile, despite the
person turning out nice, i would feel like i am picking on them <a->. when i feel like a have/had prejudice against someone and i am not 100% sure how i would have reacted if someone else did it i prefer to over-compensate just to be sure that i am not treating someone unfair</a->).<br>I also suspect that the vibe-code PR review was like
<code>i am gonna ignore that - i am not opposed enough to speak up (and critisize the author), so i'll just review the code / ignore the PR</code>.<p>If i found nu today, and knew about all this i would probably not try
it. <a->(i have seen other projects who embrace these things go downhill, so if i have 0 investment and see the signs i turn away early)</a-><br>If there was a good alternative i would probably have left.<br>And it has dampened my motivation to interact with nu:<ul><li>I spend less and less time working on my nu-related repositories the more i
notice<ul><li>I archived/abandoned some repositories since i probably won't find the
motivation for all my projects<li>I do not choose nu for new projects</ul><li>I slowly remove dependencies on nu. Partially due to nu's
instability, but also because i am unsure of its future.<li>But i am generally not in the best head-space, so well..</ul><h2 id=ideas-what-to-do>Ideas what to do</h2><ul><li>Hiding the use of AI<ul><li><strong>NO</strong></ul><li>Moving MCP out<ul><li>removing it from default features: yes<li>own repository within <code>github.com/nushell</code>: i don't know<a->/care</a->, but be aware
that it will be even more prominent (easier to find, etc) and in
combination with other signs it might put me off as a new user</ul><li>Sit down, discuss, write rules, add them to the repository, link to that
from the PR-template/README/..<ul><li>Clear cut lines avoid "i don't want to be mean and decline
this"<li>If someone notices frog-boiling they can point somewhere <a->(a common red-line makes it easier to speak up; and a written down one avoids pushing; but bending/skirting is still a thing)</a-><li>People can easily see where nu stands and decide to (not) use
it</ul></ul>
